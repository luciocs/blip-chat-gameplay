# Blip Chat Gameplay ü§ñ üí¨

## Detailed Description
Blip Chat Gameplay is a web-based demo that integrates the **Blip Chat Widget** with **OpenAI's GPT-4 API** to simulate an interactive, real-time conversation between a consumer and a Intelligent Contact. This project allows users to customize the conversation context by providing their own API keys and a system prompt.

Key features include:
- **Customizable Inputs:**  
  - Blip Chat AppKey  
  - OpenAI API Key (no default for security)  
  - System Prompt to set the conversation context  
- **Interactive Multi-turn Conversation:**  
  - Initiates with a system prompt  
  - Uses GPT-4 to generate responses  
  - Simulates message exchanges with a Blip Chat agent  
- **Modern, Responsive UI:**  
  - Clean design with Blip's blue color scheme  
  - Real-time conversation log display

## How It Works
1. **Initialization:**
   - The user inputs the Blip Chat AppKey, OpenAI API Key, and a system prompt.
   - The Blip Chat widget is initialized using the provided AppKey.
2. **Conversation Flow:**
   - The system prompt is used to generate the first GPT-4 message via the OpenAI API.
   - This message is sent to the Blip Chat widget to simulate a conversation.
   - The demo then waits for the Blip agent's response, aggregates it, and sends it back to GPT-4 for subsequent responses.
   - The cycle repeats for a set number of iterations (default is 10 cycles).
3. **Display:**
   - All exchanged messages are displayed in a conversation log within a modern, responsive interface.
